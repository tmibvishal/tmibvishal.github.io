		"Note":"<p>Here are 5 important tips to recover from Cold and Flu:</p><p><strong>1. Stay home, rest and take plenty of fluids</strong></p><p>Take plenty of rest at home which will give your body time to heal. Water, juices and comforting warm beverages will help prevent dehydration and turn thick viscid phlegm to watery mucus which can be easily coughed out.&nbsp;</p><img src='https://www.practostatic.com/fit/5a403e8166347abe1864744b6424d539cb646c5d'><p><strong>2. Inhale steam</strong></p><p>Steam inhalation: warm humidified air will ease the congestion in your nose and lungs.&nbsp;</p><p>It will help in thinning out the mucus and make breathing better. Alternatively, you can sit in the bathroom with the shower running hot water till the bathroom is filled with moist steam.&nbsp;</p><img src='https://www.practostatic.com/fit/6206a9b6b387de1912d110f85e01db32d68887b5'><p><strong>3.

Over-the-counter medicines for a cough, aches and fever</strong></p><p>You can try over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol, nasal decongestants and cough syrups after consulting with your local doctor. Never give aspirin to people younger than 19 years unless prescribed by a doctor. Lozenges will help to soothe the throat. Avoid taking antibiotics as flu is a viral infection and not bacterial unless prescribed by a doctor.&nbsp;</p><img src='https://www.practostatic.com/fit/4901a81ed109c6423ad09e2b969e6c86b48f5ed9'><p><strong>5. Saline solutions</strong></p><p>Use saline nasal sprays or drops to unblock the nose. Put some drops or spray in the nose and gently blow the mucus and saline out. Gargles with a warm saline solution will sooth down the throat and help to clear the infection.</p><img src='https://www.practostatic.com/fit/39d8eb7436dd99e7b42f64ad32f357eff593496a'><p>These measures will help ease your suffering and can result in a quicker recovery. Take appropriate precautions to prevent the spreading of flu, like covering of mouth while coughing, nose while sneezing especially when near the children.&nbsp;</p><p>Consult a Pulmonologist (Chest physician) urgently if you experience breathlessness, wheezing, troublesome cough, high fever, hoarseness of voice, vomiting or other worsening symptoms.&nbsp;</p>",
